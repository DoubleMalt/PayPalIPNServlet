This project contains a Google AppEngine project that :
* has a servlet implementing the PayPal IPN "protocol" (Instand Payment 
  Notification)
* persists all IPN messages (and parses them partially)
* uses postback validation
* a minimal Vaadin application to browse the stored IPN messages

You'll need to put a few dependencies in the lib directory:
* Vaadin (tested with 6.4.7)
* Objectify (tested with 2.2.2)


Keep in mind that the PayPal sandbox can be pretty slow. So you might get
timeouts on validation messaages (GAE has a set 10s max timeout)


Feel free to fork this project and improove it. I'd love to see some cooperation
on taming the PayPal beast :)
